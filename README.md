# Reason
  - I have a deep love for fantasy and gaming. I want to one day make my own game from scratch. 
  I remember websites where you can make characters and explore new worlds. So to get closer to my dream
  I decided to try my hand at making a fantasy adventure website. One where you can go on quest and find items to sell.
  There would be a leveling system and a battle system where you could level up and upgrade your character's stats. I also
  wanted to have a friends system and guild system so that users on the website could connect with one another and plat together.
